# Idle Item Information Sharing (I3 Sharing) Platform 

(This is the final project for **COMS 6998 Cloud Computing**. All the resources have been deleted to avoid unnecessary further charges. All the codes are provided in this repository.)

## Why this project?

For new international students, when moving into the university, they often choose to buy some second-hand items such as furniture or cookers from the graduating students at a much lower price comparing with the new one. Usually, this process is done by using social media like WeChat or Facebook.

However, it is inefficient to communicate in such a way and people may take days to weeks to find or sell items. Waiting for certain items or missing some items are very common to happen and sources are also limited since different people use different social media groups to sell or buy items. Item information are separated and they need to be centralized.  

In this motivation, we build this project.

## What is this?

Idle Item Information Sharing (I3 Sharing) Platform is a centralized platform that can gather all information about selling items. Sellers can post their items with descriptions and pictures, and buyers can just search the items they need. If buyers are interested in some items, they can directly chat with sellers to discuss more details.

## Solution Architecture Diagram

In this project, we use AWS as backend:

* Cognito: store the username and password; handle the user log in status.
* API Gateway: pass the requests to Lambda.
* Lambda: handle the requests with database.
* S3: store the image for the website.
* DynamoDB: store the data for user, item, comment, etc.
* ElasticSearch: store the keyword of the items.

For the website frontend, we use `express` module to render the `ejs` template and host our website on [HEROKU](https://heroku.com/).

## Some Features and Demos

* Maintain user login status with cookies

Users need to log in to explore our website. After login, we store the tokens generated by Cognito in browser cookies. If users close the tab and visit our website later, they do not need to log in again. Of course, if the tokens expire, or the cookie is cleared, or the users manually log out, they need to log in again.

* Home Page

After login, users can explore the homepage of our website.

* Search Item

Users can search for something they are interested in.

* Create Item and Edit Item

Users can create their idle items for sale and edit the item later.

* View Item and Write Comments

Users can view the details of the item and write some comments about this item if they want.

* Chat

Buyers can directly chat with sellers if they are interested in sellers' items.

* Privacy Protection

On the same profile page, only the owner of the user can see the whole email address. Other users who view the same url can only see part of the user email. 

On the one hand, this is the protection of the email which will not be display to anyone. On the other hand, this function is like user verification. If one user email is `****@columbia.edu`, the you know he is a Columbia University student and he is  probably not selling some fake items.

* Necessary Security Functions

**User Identity Checking**: Normally, when users explore our website, they are in a legal way. For example, they can only edit items created by themselves. However, if users accidentally or deliberately go into some improper cases, such as edit items which do not belong to them, we will check user identity in the backend and refuse the requests.

**HTML Injection Attack**: When users submit input text, we always treat it as the pure text, so these texts will never be explained as javascript or html code. They will show like normal text.

**CORS (cross-origin resource sharing)**: We set the CORS to be our domain only, so our API and Lambda will not handle requests from other malicious websites.

## Future Work

There are still some future work we can do to extend the functionality for our website. For example, we can give users suggestions about prices for their items based on the descriptions. Also, we want users to be able to search items by category and give users some recommendations about items they want to buy. Besides, users can receive notifications about messages and about some certain kind of items are on sale. After adding these features, our project can become much better.
